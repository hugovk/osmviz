"""
OpenStreetMap Animation Tool:
  - Provides easy setup to show things moving around on a map.
  - Requires pygame.

Basic idea:
  1. Create TrackingViz objects or your own custom SimViz's
  2. Create a Simulation object with those Viz's
  3. Call the Simulation's run() method
  4. Run the simulation:
     - Mouse over icons to display labels
     - up/down keys increase/decrease speed of simulation
     - left/right keys move simulation to begin/end of time window
     - space bar sets speed to zero
     - escape key exits

The TrackingViz class can be used without any knowledge of Pygame. All you
need is an image you want to put on the map and a function defining where it
should be on the map as a function of time.

For any other visualization on the map, you will want to override the
SimViz class. This will require knowledge of how to use Pygame. Basically
a Pygame Surface will be passed in when it is time to draw.

The Simulation class just does the following:
  1. Downloads OSM tiles, patches them together, and resizes
  2. Displays a window with the map on it
  3. Runs a timer and has all Viz objects draw to the map at each frame.

Keyboard input is accepted to control the speed of the simulation.
